Improving an Ouija board to provide Collective Intelligence

I attach a nice one player Ouija board. This project is to develop it into a multi-user version.
The idea is to have a moderator who asks the questions and move the planchette by the mean from the user's mouse input. The purpose is to create a tool for collective (unconscious) intelligence.

NEW REQUIREMENTS:
Moderator login (name & password required)
User login (only name required)
An algorithm to count all the users mouse movements and move the planchette by the mean.
The algorith must be able to handle at least 100 simultanteous users.
It should be impossible to tamper.
